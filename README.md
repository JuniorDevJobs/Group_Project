WELCOME TO JUNIOR DEV JOBS!

This is a project dedicated to helping junior developers find job listings without having to scan through multiple websites.
The current status of the project uses "find work" API and an "Apify" actor for Indeed jobs data in order to gather job listing data to show the user.
If the  project were to grow then we would be able to reach out to API developer services for sites such as Glassdoor or LinkedIn jobs in order to get approved access to there Jobs API services.
We would have liked to incorporate web scrapers to other sites but our research showed that some of these processes are not ethical.

For presentations purposes the app will be temporarly deployed here http://3.80.134.120:8090/
To use the app you can go to "JOB SEARCH" and search job listings though your search will not be saved unless you sign up first.
To sign up simply click the "Login" button and create an account and login. once logged in your previous search will be saved for when you next login.
